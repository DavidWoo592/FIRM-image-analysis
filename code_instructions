Use the Model_train module to train the random forest classifier model for object detection. Ensure that training images and annotated masks are saved in folders titled training_images and training_images_masks.
After running the Model_train module, a new file will be written into the folder containing the code modules and data sets for the trained model. 
Run the Feature_detect module to use the trained model to detect features in new images. The images you want to use should be saved in a folder titled testing_images.
